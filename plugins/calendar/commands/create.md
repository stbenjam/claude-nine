---

Help me create a new calendar event. Ask me for the following details:
1. Which calendar to use (Home, Work, stephen@bitbin.de, stbenjam@redhat.com)
2. Event title/summary
3. Date and time
4. Duration (default to 1 hour if not specified)
5. Location (optional)
6. Any notes or description (optional)
7. Whether to add a reminder (optional)

Once I provide the details, create the event using AppleScript and confirm it was created successfully.
